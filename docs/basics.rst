Usage
*****

``rapids-cmake`` is designed for projects to use only the subset of features that they need. To enable
this `rapids-cmake` comprises the following primary components:

- `cmake <api.html#common>`__
- `cpm <api.html#cpm>`__
- `cuda <api.html#cuda>`__
- `export <api.html#export>`__
- `find <api.html#find>`__

There are two ways projects can use ``rapids-cmake`` functions.

1. Call ``include(rapids-<component>)``, which imports commonly used functions for the component.
2. Load each function independently via ``include(${rapids-cmake-dir}/<component>/<function_name>.cmake)``.
