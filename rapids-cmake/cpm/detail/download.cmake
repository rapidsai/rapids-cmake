rapids_cpm_download
-------------------

.. versionadded:: v21.10.00

Does the downloading of the `CPM` module

.. code-block:: cmake

  rapids_cpm_download()

The CPM module will be downloaded based on the following.

.. versionadded:: v24.10.00

If :cmake:variable:`CPM_DOWNLOAD_LOCATION` is defined that location will be used
as the download location. If a file already exists at that location no download will occur

If the :cmake:variable:`CPM_SOURCE_CACHE` or :cmake:variable:`ENV{CPM_SOURCE_CACHE}` are
defined those will be used to compute a location for the file.

If none of the above variables are defined, rapids-cmake will download the file
to `cmake` directory under :cmake:variable:`CMAKE_BINARY_DIR`.

.. note::
  Use `rapids_cpm_init` instead of this function, as this is an implementation detail
  required for proper cpm project exporting in build directories

  This function can't call other rapids-cmake functions, due to the
  restrictions of `write_dependencies.cmake`
