rapids_cpm_init
-------------------

.. versionadded:: v21.06.00

Establish the `CPM` infrastructure for the project.

.. code-block:: cmake

  rapids_cpm_init()

The CPM module will be downloaded based on the state of :cmake:variable:`CPM_SOURCE_CACHE` and
:cmake:variable:`ENV{CPM_SOURCE_CACHE}`. This allows multiple nested projects to share the
same download of CPM. If those variables aren't set the file will be cached
in the build tree of the calling project

.. note::
  Must be called before any invocation of :cmake:command:`rapids_cpm_find`.
