rapids_find_package
--------------

.. versionadded:: v21.06.00

Allow projects to find dependencies via `find_package` with built-in
tracking of these dependencies for correct export support.

.. code-block:: cmake

  rapids_find_package(<PackageName>
                      [REQUIRED]
                      [GLOBAL_TARGETS <targets...>]
                      [BUILD_EXPORT_SET <name>]
                      [INSTALL_EXPORT_SET <name>]
                      [ <FIND_ARGS>
                        all normal find_package options ]
                      )

Generate a :cmake:command:`find_package` call and associate this with the listed
build and install export set for correct export generation.

Since the visibility of CMake's targets differ between targets built locally and those
imported, :cmake:command:`rapids_find_package` promotes imported targets to be global
so users have consistency. List all targets used by your project in `GLOBAL_TARGET`.

.. note::
  If the project/package you are looking for doesn't have an existing
  CMake Find module, please look at using :cmake:command:`rapids_find_generate_module`.

``PackageName``
  Name of the package to find.

``GLOBAL_TARGETS``
  Which targets from this package should be made global. This information
  will be propagated to any associated export set.

``BUILD_EXPORT_SET``
  Record that a :cmake:command:`find_dependency(<PackageName>)` call needs to occur
  as part of our build directory export set.

``INSTALL_EXPORT_SET``
  Record that a :cmake:command:`find_dependency(<PackageName>)` call needs to occur
  as part of our build directory export set.

``FIND_ARGS``
  Required placeholder to be provied before any extra arguments that need to
  be passed down to cmake:command:`find_pacakge`
